							<p>NITKRacing is NITK's answer to the Formula Student question: Can a bunch of students make a Formula One style
							single seater performance car? Based on a rigorous rulebook, students are challenged to design, fabricate and (mock)sell a weekend
							racecar at competitions around the world. Formula Student is not only a excrutiatingly intensive student project but also has become a student cultural
							phenomenon that has now become grounds for valuable research, innovative solutions and even recruitments</p>
							<p>I was a part of NITKRacing from 2016 to 2019 during which I participated in 3 events. In these events I was exposed to brilliant automotive engineering,
							knowledge of industry experts, and an invaluable team buuilding experience. But, as great as the events are, the bulk of the experience lies in the journey to these events.
						 	Designing a complete racecar within a year in a college environment is a daunting challenge. I was a part of the vehicle dynamics team which was responsible for everything around the
							drive train that took the torque from the live axle and pushed it against the tarmac. This includes designiing the chassis, suspension, steering and the brakes.
						 	The design process encompassed everything from fancy FEM analysis of every manufactured component to the fundamental mathematical models that the entire car was based on.
							Initially being heavily involved with part design such as brake pedals, uprights, wheel hubs, etc.; over time I slowly migrated towards suspension design and analysis.
							Here's a picture of the newer team and their car:

							<p>I was also elected the captain of this team for the year of 2018-2019, where we participated in Formula Bharat with a 220kg machine with a KMT 390 motor.
							This is where I could get a higher level understanding of what makes a good team and a successful project. Immaculate attention to detail, uncompromising
							expectation of quality and most of all putting in the time and effort: Things that I took away from NITKRacing and hopefully also left behind.
